     <h3> My Site Report </h3>
   
       <p>When I started coding this website it was not easy at the beginning, for example I did not know how to the html and CSS work together to make something that looks really good. If you want to do everything with just html it is not easy to get the same result that you want. Html helps you to build the page and for designing it you must use CSS. For this website I have used Grid layout which we started leaning at the beginning of the year. I have used display grid for my website because it is easy compare to the old one and you can do anything that you want. For example: </p>


     <img src="../mynewwebsite/images/body.PNG" alt="My body css" class="responsive">
     


     <p>If you open the website, I have used display grid for my website. Everything that you see on the website is using this. for example, I have three different sections in my website: Header, Nav, Main, Aside and the footer and if you see on the website you will be able to see all the different sections. If you see the grid template column line you will see that I have given %20 to the Nav, %60 to the main content of the page and %20 more to the sidebar of my website.</p>

     <img src="../mynewwebsite/images/mobile.PNG" alt="From web to mobile"class="responsive">

       <p>If you see in this screenshot you will be able to see that I have created two different CSS file and if the user opens the website in computer they will go to the web version which the Minimum width 800px and if they open it in a mobile phone then they will go to the mobile version.</p>
